# What is Understack?

Understack is a collection of open-source tools and technologies that provides
flexible, scalable, and cost-effective infrastructure management solution. The
focus is on deploying bare metal in data centers with functional DCIM and IPAM.

## About the Guide

This guide is not meant to be a definitive guide to [GitOps][gitops] and
how it can be used with UnderStack or even a best practices example
but instead focused on an example _development_ oriented installation.
It will make a few assumptions and some opinionated choices that may
not align with a production best practices installation.
